# SYNOPSIS

```javascript
import when from '@chocolatey/when'

const onPageShow = when(done => {
    window.addEventListener('pageshow', done)
})

// callback
onPageShow(event => addWidget(user))

// promise
onPageShow().then(([event]) => addWidget(user))
```

<!-- TOC:ignore -->
#### cancel a listener

```javascript
const unsubscribe = onPageShow(() => addWidget(user))

// ...

if (!user.loggedIn) {
    unsubscribe()
}
```

<!-- TOC:ignore -->
#### handle listener errors

```javascript
const onReady = when(
    done => emitter.once('ready', done),
    error => errors.push(error)
)

onReady(() => loadFile(path))
// errors.push(new Error("no such file..."))
```

# DESCRIPTION

`when` provides a way to register listeners for a function call before or after
the function is called. This can be used to "pin" events (or other kinds of
signal/notification) so that they can be consumed after they've fired.

## Why?

Several events and notifications that are published as transient,
fire-and-forget messages are better thought of as *states*, e.g. "ready"
notifications for services, or lifecycle events for web pages. They tend to be
fired once, and we often need to know that they've fired *after* the fact. This
usage is not supported by most event-emitters, and handling it manually can
involve fiddly imperative code which obscures the simple semantics.

This module exports a function which effectively allows notifications to be
*pinned* like "sticky" announcements on a notice-board or forum, rather than
the blink-and-you-miss-it behavior of events, removing the timing-sensitivity
which can make the event-based representation of these states inconvenient or
unreliable.

## Why not?

`when` provides a way to pin notifications when a framework or library doesn't
provide a way to do that itself, e.g. when consuming events produced by most
event-emitters. But if you control/emit the notifications yourself, and want
consumers to be able to continue subscribing to them after they've been
published, this can be handled in the notifier itself, e.g. by using an
event-emitter with support for pinned events such as [fixed-event][] or
[ipc-event-emitter][].

# TYPES

The following types are referenced in the descriptions below.

```typescript
export type Callback  = (done: <A extends any[]>(...args: A) => void) => void;
export type ErrorHandler = (error: any) => void;
export type Listener = <A extends any[]>(this: unknown, ...args: A) => void;

export interface Subscribe {
    <A extends any[]>(): Promise<A>;
    (listener: Listener): () => boolean;
};
```

# EXPORTS

## default

- **Type**: `(callback: Callback, onError?: ErrorHandler) => Subscribe`

```javascript
import when from '@chocolatey/when'

const onPageShow = when(done => {
    window.addEventListener('pageshow', done)
})

user.getData(url) // load data if not cached

onPageShow(event => addWidget(user))
```

`when` passes a delegating function to a callback and returns a function which
registers listeners to be called when the delegate is called. Listeners are
passed the same arguments and `this` value as the delegate and are executed
asynchronously. Listeners registered after the delegate has been called are
invoked immediately.

When the returned function is passed a listener, it returns a function which
can be used to unregister the listener if it hasn't already been called. The
function returns true if the listener was unregistered (i.e. not already
called), or false otherwise.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = onPageShow(() => addWidget(user))

// ...

if (!user.loggedIn) {
    unsubscribe() // true if unregistered
}
```

If the listener is omitted, a promise is returned which is resolved with the
array of arguments passed to the delegate.

```javascript
onPageShow().then(([event]) => addWidget(user))

const [event] = await onPageShow()
```

`when` takes an optional error-handler which is passed any error which occurs
when a listener is invoked. If not supplied, listener errors are logged with
`console.error`.

```javascript
const onReady = when(
    done => emitter.once('ready', done),
    error => errors.push(error)
)

onReady(() => loadFile(path))
// errors.push(new Error("no such file..."))
```

The delegate function records the arguments and `this` value the first time
it's called and subsequent calls are ignored, i.e. it behaves like it's only
called once. This makes it safe to use with events that may be called multiple
times, though arranging for the delegate to only be called once is still
recommended in this case to avoid spamming it with redundant calls.

```javascript
const onBeforeLoad = when(done => {
    window.addEventListener('onbeforeload', done, { once: true })
})
```
